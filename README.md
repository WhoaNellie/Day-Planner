# Day-Planner

## Description

This is my fifth project for UA's coding bootcamp. It is a Day Planner that allows the user to save events to each hour of the day and features dynamically updates HTML and CSS using jQuery.

## Installation

To install this project all you need to do is download the repository and open index.html using your browser of choice. Alternatively, you could just go to the github page for this website.

## Usage

To use this project, enter any notes you wish to save for that hour of the day into the middle collumn and click the corresponding "Save" button. Your notes for that hour will be saved in local storage and will be available to you when you return to the page.

The page will refresh on the hour and update whether the events have passed.

## Credits
